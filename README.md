 # download-blocked-files

For frustrated users who just want to download their shit at work, but are unfortunately cockblocked by overly stringent firewall rules or network policies.


A [third-party server](https://pythonanywhere.com) fetches the file you want to download on your behalf, and encrypts it with some shitty password (1234) so that the encrypted file evades detection from monitors. Finally, it returns you the encrypted file.


EDIT: Changed from pythonanywhere.com to [heroku](https://heroku.com).
