 # download-blocked-files

For frustrated users who just want to download their shit, but are unfortunately cockblocked by overly stringent firewall rules or network policies.


A [third-party server](https://pythonanywhere.com) fetches the file you want to download on your behalf, and encrypts it with some shitty password (1234) so that the encrypted file evades detection from monitors. Finally, it returns you the encrypted file.

EDIT: Apparently pythonanywhere.com maintains a [whitelist](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/whitelist/) for free accounts so until I find a better solution, we'll have to make do with only the whitelisted domains.
